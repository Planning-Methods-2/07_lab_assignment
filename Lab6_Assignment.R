# Lab 6 Assignment: Chi-Square and Correlation
# The University of Texas at San Antonio
# URP-5393: Urban Planning Methods II


#---- Instructions ----

# 1. [70 points] Open the R file "Lab6_Assignment.R" and answer the questions bellow
# 2. [30 points] Run a Chi-Square and Correlation analysis in your data used to the final project. 


#---- Part 1.

# 1.1 load the same household data used in the Lab6_Script.R file, create the object `HTS`



# 2. Create an object called `HTS_tab` that has the frequency or contingency table for the variables `htype` and `income_cat`
# Refer to the BQRM book (p.13) if you don't know what the variables mean




#3. run a Chi-Square test to show if the two variables above are associated or not. Provide an interpretation of the p-value and a sentence stating if the null hypothesis of no association should be rejected or not. What conclusions can you draw?



#4. Calculate the Cramer's V coefficient for your Chi-Square test. What conclusions can you draw?



#5. Calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between the variables `veh` and `hhincome`. What can you say about the relationship between these two variables?



#6. Calculate the spearman correlation coefficient between the variables `hhsize` and `income_cat`. What can you say about the relationship between these two variables?


#---- Part 2.
# The more you do to explore your data sets with these two new tools, the more you will learn and become familiar. If you do only the minimum (calculate a chi-Square test and a correlation coefficient) is fine, but the more you do to explore the relationships that should be in your conceptual framework, the better.
